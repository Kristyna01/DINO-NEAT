  Google Chrome-like game with artificial inteligence with help of NEAT
##########################################################################

To run the programm you'll need pygame and neat (and other common libraries)

Feel free to mess with the config file and see how it affects the behaviour of the Dino :)
(Note that it's not perfect yet, but he's trying his best, I swear!)

Ps.: Runs on linux, did not tested it on windows...
