# DINO-NEAT

Google Chrome-like game with artificial inteligence with help of NEAT

To run the programm you'll need pygame and neat (and other common libraries)

Feel free to mess with the config file and see how it affects the behaviour of the Dino :)
(Note that it's not perfect yet, but he's trying his best, I swear!)

Ps.: Runs on linux, not tested it on windows...


If you're interested in how NEAT works check out this paper or thei website ;)
